## Project Overview for New Contributors

This project is a React Native application designed to aggregate products from multiple ecommerce platforms. The codebase is organized to help you quickly find what you need and start contributing.

### Major Folders and Files

- **/App.js**: The main entry point of the app. Sets up the root component and navigation.
- **/screens/**: Contains all the screen components (e.g., HomeScreen) that represent different pages or views in the app.
- **/components/**: Reusable UI components used across different screens (e.g., buttons, product cards).
- **/assets/**: Images, icons, and other static resources.
- **/services/**: Code for API calls and data fetching from ecommerce sources.
- **/navigation/**: (If present) Handles navigation logic between screens.
- **/README.md**: This file. Contains documentation and guidelines.

Currently, this project is frontend-only and does not include a backend or database. All data fetching is handled via APIs to external ecommerce platforms.

### How Components Interact

- **App.js** loads the main screen(s) and sets up the app structure.
- **Screens** use **components** to build UI and call functions from **services** to fetch data.
- **Services** handle communication with external APIs.
